# Yahtzee-Demo

This repository contains three Java scripts: `Die.java` representing a simple six-sided die, and `Yahtzee.java` implementing the game Yahtzee. Additionally, the `Main.java` file demonstrates the integration of these scripts to simulate the Yahtzee game.

### Die Class (`Die.java`)

The `Die` class provides a simple representation of a six-sided die. It includes methods to roll the die and retrieve its current value.

### Yahtzee Class (`Yahtzee.java`)

The `Yahtzee` class simulates the Yahtzee game, utilizing the `Die` class for handling individual dice. It includes methods for rolling dice, calculating scores based on Yahtzee rules, and providing a scorecard.

### Main Class (`Main.java`)

The `Main` class demonstrates the integration of the `Die` and `Yahtzee` classes to play the Yahtzee game. It showcases how to initialize a Yahtzee game, roll dice, reroll selected dice, and display the current state and scorecard.
